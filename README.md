## Overview of course

Financial engineering is the application of mathematical, statistical and engineering methods and computing techniques for solving financial problems. IE 420 is an introductory course in this area. It is suitable for undergraduate and graduate students with basic probability and statistics background and computer programming skills. IE 420 introduces the basic theory and practice of financial engineering.

In addition to regular homework assignments, the course usually comes with essays and a project. 3 undergraduate hours. 4 graduate hours. Prerequisite: IE 300.


## What is required to run these HW files

This respository so far consists of the use of python notebooks, python libraries such as SciPy, NumPy, and Pandas, as well as Microsoft Excel functions. I fully expect this list to expand, however, if were so inclined to run this code properly, the latest version of andaconda or python with the aforementioned libraries would suffice for the most part.
